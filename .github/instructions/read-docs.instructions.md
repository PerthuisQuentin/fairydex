# Project Prompt Instructions

For every command or action performed in this project, it is **mandatory** to first read the documentation files in the `docs` folder. In particular, always start by reading `docs/README.md` to understand the documentation structure and to identify which file is most pertinent for your task.

- The `docs/README.md` provides an index and overview of all available documentation files.
- Each documentation file in `docs/` focuses on a specific aspect of the project (e.g., file organization, components, navigation, etc.).
- Before making changes, implementing features, or answering questions, consult the relevant documentation to ensure your actions are consistent with project conventions and structure.

**Failure to follow this instruction may result in mistakes, inconsistencies, or redundant work.**

Always check the documentation first!
